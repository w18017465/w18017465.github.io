	<p>Throughout the last year I have worked on many different projects within University, this page gives an overview of some of them to give you an idea of the experience I have so far. At the bottom of the page are also some personal projects that I worked on outside of University.</p>
	
	<div class="project">
	<h2>Literature Review of Serious Games For Health</h2>
	<img src="img\LitReview.png" width="360" height= "220">
	<p>During the second semester of my first year I was tasked with writing my own Literature Review on one subject out of a list. I chose to write the Review on the topic of 'Serious Games for Health', in which I wrote a 1000 word report and analysis of 6 different papers on the subject. I settled on Serious Games for Health because I believe it is a topic that could hold a key position in the future and I believed that writing a report on it then could help in the future if I do decide to pursue the topic as a full course.</p>

	<h2>Working with a Team to produce a Portfolio Video Tutorial</h2>
	<img src="img\PortfolioVideo.png" width="360" height= "200">
	<p>Also during the second semester of my first year I worked together with my tutor group - 8 individuals in total - to produce an educational video that would explain to a student how to make their own portfolio. Much of the advice in the video has been followed by me when making this website, so I feel like I can say it is a reliable resource. The work was 'democratically' split between the group, with some of us doing more than others, and was a unique team exercise for us to take a step out of our usual coding/reporting comfort zone.</p>

	<h2>Low Level Language coding with Nano on Raspberry Pi</h2>
	<img src="img\CSC1024.png" width="360" height= "215">
	<p>Throughout the first year I have been continually writing Low Level Language on the University's Raspberry Pis with the use of the Nano text editor. Some of the various programs I have written in this manner include check bit generation and correction for 4 bit and 16 bit data words, as well as other tasks that output the results of calculations to the monitor screen. Writing with Assembly Language has been a learning experience, as until now I have primarily used high level language such as Python, Java and Visual Basic so working with basic Low Level programs has improved my range of coding ability. The tasks have been getting increasingly harder, constantly improving upon my knowledge and requiring me to go back to reuse and improve previous implementation of similar ideas.</p>

	<div class="project">
	<h2>Creating Informational Website for Braille</h2>
	<img src="img\BrailleWebsite.png" width="360" height= "215">
	<p>During the Website Development module I have created multiple websites. This website that gives a detailed description of Braille has been the most advanced website I have created up until now, and has required the use of a lot of CSS magic to make the end result look exactly like the desired product. This website received high marks, with mention in particular to how it looks identical to the desired look, and the functionality is also spot on. The only issues I had at the time was my coding style sometimes lead to some poor HTML, but that has since been rectified as I complete more websites.</p>

	<h2>JapanEasy VB</h2>
	<img src="img\JapanEasy.png" width="360" height= "230">
	<p>JapanEasy VB was a program that I wrote while in Sixth Form for my A-level Computer Science coursework. It was a quite advanced language teaching software that aimed to teach a user a comprehensive understanding of the 3 different Japanese Writing Styles as well as acting as a customisable phrasebook. The program was written entirely using Visual Basic and the GUI designed using Visual Studio's .Net editor, with all of the content aside from the background art being created by me. This is my favourite and both the largest and most ambitious project I have worked on to date, and it shows with the level of complexity that can be found within the program. In the future I intend to come back and completely finish this program, likely after rewriting it in a different language, and possibly release it to the public as a free open-source software - a very useful thing for people that wish to learn new languages.</p>

	<h2>Hearts of Iron 4 Video Game Modding</h2>
	<img src="img\MilDawn.jpg" width="360" height= "220">
	<p>I have mentioned that in my spare time I am prone to playing Video Games. One such video game I enjoy is called 'Hearts Of Iron', a WW2 RISK-esque conquest simulator in which players control their own countries and manage wars. This game is highly moddable, and has a very large active modding community and during my time playing the game I have also created some mods for it. The most popular mod, with over 22 thousand active subscribers, is a mod I created solely by myself to allow players to have fun playing as the Vatican City with reworks of events, images and gameplay. The mod is highly rated, and I keep it updated in the same way a video game developer updates their game with new features over time.</p>
