	<p>Throughout our time we have worked on many different projects within the sanitorium, this page gives an overview of some of them to give you an idea of what we have accomplished.</p>
	
	<div class="project">
	<h2>Literature Review of Alternative Medicines For Health</h2>
	<img src="" width="360" height= "220">
	<p>During the second half of our first year here we wrote our own literature review on one subject we were familiar with. We chose to write the review on the topic of 'Alternative Medicines for Health', in which we wrote a report and analysis of 6 different papers on the subject. We settled on Alternative Medicines for Health because we believe it is a topic that could hold a key position in the future of medicines and I believed that writing a report on it then could help in the future if we decide to only use non-traditional healing techniques for the body and soul.</p>

	<h2>Working with a Team to produce a Complementary Medicine Video Tutorial</h2>
	<img src="img\PortfolioVideo.png" width="360" height= "200">
	<p>As a part of our early moments as a sanitorium we worked together with experts - 10 experts in total - to produce an educational video that would explain to a patient how to make their own dosages of our prescribed medicine. Much of the advice in the video has been followed by patients when they take their treatments with great success, so it is a reliable resource. The work on the video was democratically split between the experts and our medical caregivers, with some of us doing more than others, and was a unique team collaboration for us to work with professionals from around the globe.</p>

	<h2>Creating Informational Website for Treatment Providers</h2>
	<img src="img\BrailleWebsite.png" width="360" height= "215">
	<p>During the process of educating patients on treatment providers we have created multiple websites. These websites that give detailed descriptions of the providers of the most advanced treatments we have helped develop up until now, and has required the use of a lot of experiments to make the end result look exactly like the desired effect. We understand that treatments can often result in sights that can be beyond what could be considered conventional. Thus we thought it necessary to include the providers and growers of parts of our medicines to help ease the mind of prospective patients so they feel confident about leaving their wellbeing to us.</p>
