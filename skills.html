	<p>Throughout our time treating patients we have acquired a number of skills that can be very useful when working professionally in the area of medicine. This section of the website lists a few of the skills and exactly what use they have.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Knowledge and Understanding</strong> - We have developed our knowledge over the course of our own education, research and refining our skills through applying our knowledge to real life cases.</li>
		<li><strong>Teamwork</strong> - Many of the projects we have worked on both inside and outside of the sanitorium have required me to work together with other individual experts from outisde our organisation.</li>	
		<li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Critical thinking is a useful skill to have inside and outside the area of alternative medical treatments and therapies. We analyse data from experiments we have conducted to determine what the best treatment approach is for individuals in order to expertly cater to their precise needs to deliver them from what is a cause for concern to themselves.</li>
		<li><strong>Data Synthesis</strong> - Academic papers are of great importance to us as an organisation of science but also truth. These academic papers require a large amount of Data Synthesis, as we have to gather data from various sources both online and offline then simplify and compile them in a concise manner. This is a handy skill to have in the realm of practising medicine, as most medical programs are designed based on sets of data and as such it is important to know how the data should be interpreted and utilised.</li>
		<li><strong>Planning and Organisation</strong> - Prior planning is the keystone of many programming projects, and the ones I have done in university are no different. Before any project I always make sure I come up with a plan on how I would tackle the requirements and assign time for each part, allowing me to carefully work through the project giving attention where it is needed and always staying on schedule. Poor planning is a major reason why many projects fail in Software Engineering, so I continually try to improve mine.</li>	
		<li><strong>Problem Solving</strong> - Programming can be considered to be just one long series of problem solving, as a program itself is usually designed to solve some sort of Problem that a potential user would face - whether that be boredom, communication, etc.. Since I started writing code back in GCSE I have been gradually improving my problem solving ability to help me program more efficiently and work on more complex issues.</li>
		<li><strong>Working under Pressure</strong> - Everyone is aware that jobs can be stressful, Software Engineering in particular can be a very demanding sector due to machine issues, complex nature of programs and the amount of teamwork needed even for smaller projects. In my time in university I have also experienced stress that comes with working on projects close to the deadline. This experience is important for someone looking for a job in Software Engineering as an employer must know that their new employee will not crumble under the pressure when it matters most.</li>
