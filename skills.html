	<p>Throughout our time treating patients we have acquired a number of skills that can be very useful when working professionally in the area of medicine. This section of the website lists a few of the skills and exactly what use they have.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Knowledge and Understanding</strong> - We have developed our knowledge over the course of our own education, research and refining our skills through applying our knowledge to real life cases.</li>
		<li><strong>Teamwork</strong> - Many of the projects we have worked on both inside and outside of the sanitorium have required me to work together with other individual experts from outisde our organisation.</li>	
		<li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Critical thinking is a useful skill to have inside and outside the area of alternative medical treatments and therapies. We analyse data from experiments we have conducted to determine what the best treatment approach is for individuals in order to expertly cater to their precise needs to deliver them from what is a cause for concern to themselves.</li>
		<li><strong>Data Synthesis</strong> - Academic papers are of great importance to us as an organisation of science but also truth. These academic papers require a large amount of Data Synthesis, as we have to gather data from various sources both online and offline then simplify and compile them in a concise manner. This is a handy skill to have in the realm of practising medicine, as most medical programs are designed based on sets of data and as such it is important to know how the data should be interpreted and utilised.</li>
		<li><strong>Planning and Organisation</strong> - It is vital in the treatment of any patient that the professionals giving the care know precisely what they are going to do for the patient. This is important so we have planned treatments for typical cases. However we know that every patient is different and therefore we give specific care to each and every patient but we know that many patients would benefit from what others have tried with success.</li>	
		<li><strong>Problem Solving</strong> - Each case that we deal with at the sanitorium is handled with extreme care. Each person who arrives here may need different ingredients to unlock their freedom. Through the use of our thinking and problem solving we often come to a swift conclusion for the course of treatment we will give to the individual who has come to us for the help we will gladly deliver.</li>
		<li><strong>Working under Pressure</strong> - It is always possible that those who have received treatments with us may have bodies and minds that do not desire to be healed. Therefore some may need to have further steps taken with pressure placed on our teams to cure them which could include surgery. Our experts can handle this great pressure and they have all been trained to handle it.</li>
