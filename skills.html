	<p>Throughout my 18 years of living I have acquired a number of skills that can be very useful when working professionally in the area of computers. This section of my portfolio lists a few of these skills and exactly what use they have.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Knowledge and Understanding</strong> - Naturally I have a very high level of knowledge and understanding when it comes to computers. During the many years I have been studying Computer Science at various levels I have been learning more and more about professional Computer Science and how to work in a professional environment. I am fluent in Java, C# and Visual Basic and I also have good experience with HTML. One of the top priorities when working in Software Engineering is having the key knowledge required and the understanding to use it, and I would say that I am very much capable in this aspect.</li>
		<li><strong>Teamwork</strong> - Many of the projects I have worked on both inside and outside of university have required me to work together with other individuals. Within University teamwork I have often assumed the role of the team leader, managing roles of the other members and trying to organise the workload, but I am also very capable of following instructions and working beneath somebody else as I have typically done when working on outside projects. I know that very few modern programs are written by solo devs, so being able to work together with a group is a necessary skill.</li>	
		<li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Critical thinking is a useful skill to have inside and outside the area of Software Engineering. This skill is useful within the area because it allows me to determine how to allocate my time and focus when working on a project, as Critical Thinking helps me to make an informed judgement about what needs working on the most. In daily life it also has a lot of use as it is important that when you reach an opinion on any issue - work related or not - it should be backed up with reason and analysis.</li>
		<li><strong>Data Synthesis</strong> - During University I have taken part in writing multiple reports and my own Literature Review. These academic papers require a large amount of Data Synthesis, as I have to gather data from various sources both online and offline then simplify and compile them into a shorter essay. This is a handy skill to have in the realm of Software Engineering, as most programs are designed based on sets of data and as such it is important to know how the data should be interpreted and utilised.</li>
		<li><strong>English Literacy</strong> - As expected, I hold a very high level of English literacy. I am proficient in writing grammatically correct documents with required sources and structured layout, an important part of report writing. I also know how to efficiently use the internet to find and collect information.</li>	
		<li><strong>Active and Independent learning</strong> - University can quite often be a little bit of a 'hands off' experience. As a student, I attend lectures that teach me the basic knowledge, requirements and abilities for specific modules but the University lectures only go so far. Most Coursework that I have done while at University have required me to go beyond what has been taught to me and do individual research or learning in order to properly fulfil the project in its entirety, and as a result I am capable of doing my own research independently which allows me to learn exactly how I want to in an efficient manner.</li>	
		<li><strong>Planning and Organisation</strong> - Prior planning is the keystone of many programming projects, and the ones I have done in university are no different. Before any project I always make sure I come up with a plan on how I would tackle the requirements and assign time for each part, allowing me to carefully work through the project giving attention where it is needed and always staying on schedule. Poor planning is a major reason why many projects fail in Software Engineering, so I continually try to improve mine.</li>	
		<li><strong>Creativity</strong> - Creativity is a difficult skill to improve yourself, however I am lucky to have a lot of natural creativity. I often come up with new ideas and implementations for them, even if I don't intend to pursue them. The ability to imagine and come up with your own ideas and methodologies comes in very handy when trying to create a product from scratch, as it often means you can avoid having a generic program or one that nobody has any reason to use over a different one.</li>	
		<li><strong>Problem Solving</strong> - Programming can be considered to be just one long series of problem solving, as a program itself is usually designed to solve some sort of Problem that a potential user would face - whether that be boredom, communication, etc.. Since I started writing code back in GCSE I have been gradually improving my problem solving ability to help me program more efficiently and work on more complex issues.</li>
		<li><strong>Occupational Awareness</strong> - One of the modules I have covered in University is dedicated entirely to being a Software Engineering Professional. Throughout the topic I have learned a great amount on how individuals work in the programming business, it has been very useful in teaching me skills that I would need to work solo or as a team in a workplace environment, such as Report Writing, Effective Communication and working with short deadlines.</li>	
		<li><strong>Working under Pressure</strong> - Everyone is aware that jobs can be stressful, Software Engineering in particular can be a very demanding sector due to machine issues, complex nature of programs and the amount of teamwork needed even for smaller projects. In my time in university I have also experienced stress that comes with working on projects close to the deadline. This experience is important for someone looking for a job in Software Engineering as an employer must know that their new employee will not crumble under the pressure when it matters most.</li>
