	<p>Welcome! This is the website for Pallid Veil Sanitorium, a medical centre that offers much more than just tradtional treatments. This website lists projects we have worked on, the skills we offer and contact details - looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
	<p>For the last 9 months we have been treating patients with our own unique therapies. During this time we have worked on 5 different areas of medicine: Psychiatry, Neurology, Ophthalmology, Internal Medicine and Anesthesiology. These areas of medicine have taught us a large amount of knowledge, despite how short our time has been so far, we have developed our key skills that you can find under the <a href="skills.html">skills</a> section. In the future we plan on specialising in psychopharmaceuticals and physical interactions between professionals and patients, however that may change in the future due to the many marvellously fascinating different treatments available.</p>
	<p>Outside of surgery we are also no stranger to therapy, having grown from a young organisation using a variety of treatments resulting in a competent fluency even when working with an unfamiliar patient or on an unknown ailment or affliction.
