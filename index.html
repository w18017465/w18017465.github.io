	<p>Hello There! This is the portfolio of Christopher Goddard, an aspiring Computer Science Student at Newcastle University. This website lists projects I've worked on, my skills and my contact details - looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
	<p>For the last 9 months I have been studying my first year of a 4 year Computer Science undergraduate course. During this time I have worked on 5 different areas of learning: Programming, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, Mathematics and Website Development. These modules have taught me already a large amount of knowledge, despite how short my time has been with them so far, and have allowed me to develop many key skills that you can find under my <a href="skills.html">skills</a> section. In the future I plan on specialising in Human-Computer Interfaces and physical interactions between machines and users, however that may change in the future due to the many marvellously fascinating different courses available.</p>
	<p>Outside of University I am also no stranger to computers and programming, having grown up from a young age using a computer resulting in a competent fluency even when working in an unfamiliar environment or on an unknown topic. In my spare time I can often be found on my computer, perhaps browsing the internet, coding for fun or playing video games, or enjoying various forms of literature.
